    <p> Tacos Al Pastor originated with Lebanese immigrants in central Mexico who would cook schwarma style by grilling meat on a spit. Local Mexicans adapted this cooking method with their own traditional flavors.Pork is marinated in a combination of dried chilies, spices and pineapple. In some places, achiote is also added, and then slowly cooked with a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a trompo (spinning top), very similar to how shawarma is cooked, with a piece of fresh onion and a pineapple on top. When ready, the meat is then thinly sliced off the spit with a large knife. It is served on small tortillas, with finely chopped onions, cilantro, and occasionally a small slice of pineapple, and usually topped with some lemon or lime juice and hot salsa.
